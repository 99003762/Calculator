 |LLR For Trigonometric Function| 
                             (1) Trignometric calculater use the taylor series for Sin/cos/tan/cot or CORDIC Algorithm.
                             (2)Input required is a number in Radian Theta,which range between -Pie/2 to +Pie/2.
                             (3)Ist convert given input in radian by diving input by 180 and multiply by Pie=3.14
